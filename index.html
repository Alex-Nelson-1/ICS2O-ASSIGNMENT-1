      <h2>What did Larry Page do?</h2>
      <br />

        <p>
          Larry page is a famous American computer scientist for creating
          Google, along with Sergey Brin, a search engine that has become one of
          the most popular search engines today. The first search engine that
          Brin and Page, ever made was called "Backrub". The code that Larry
          Page and Sergey Brin wrote for Backrub, dubbed PageRank,
          revolutionized the way search engines were made. PageRank took into
          account the number of pages, as well as the importance of the pages,
          whereas every other engine ranked sites by how often a search term
          appeared. The search engine "Google" has become the most popular
          search engine to date by far, with an estimated 91% of searches going
          through Google. After making making a load of money through Google,
          Larry decided to invest in startups for flying cars.
